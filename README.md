## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to My GitHub! ðŸš€

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a physicist and programmer navigating the multiverse of quantum theory and high-energy physics (with a dash of particle physics and theoretical computer science for flavor).

A Quick Snapshot of Me:
	â€¢	ðŸ“œ B.A. in Physics & Computer Science: Because one major just wasnâ€™t enough.
	â€¢	ðŸŽ“ M.Sc. in Physics: Specialized in quantum information science and technologyâ€”essentially teaching computers how to think like SchrÃ¶dingerâ€™s cat.
	â€¢	ðŸ”¬ Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics: Currently deep-diving into the quirks of quantum theory with the help of GPUs, supercomputers, and some serious programming wizardry.

Interests:

From smashing particles to unraveling the mysteries of quantum computing, I love exploring high-energy physics, quantum mechanics, and anything that blends physics and code.

So, if youâ€™re into physics, coding, or just want to discuss why E=mcÂ² makes the universe cooler, youâ€™re in the right place!
